This is made like a 2FA for the script incase of any leaks. 
If anyone does leak, this script will do its best to kick you out the game to prevent you from using the script


How to whitelist someone in order:
[userid] = "PlayerUsername";

replace the "[userid]" with their roblox user id and the "PlayerUsername" with their own roblox full username for example:
[3149596682] = 'sptth_h'
]]

local plr = game.Players.LocalPlayer
local userid = game.Players.LocalPlayer.UserId

local Whitelisted = {
[12067864] = 'ryufklw6ssxi0tizp7ku';
[4471149402] = 'myrobloxiscool124';
[3068086141] = "IAmAFailureOnLife"; --sheesh
[4334472531] = "Evjo1200d"; --squeezy
[12644273] = "gpp5qdt8e9tk1evmdb1p"; --rdu
[3627457043] = "repopulatethealts"; --rdu

}

local Reasons = {
    "You were kicked. Why? Not whitelisted to use script"; --1
    "execute this script when you become whitelisted"; --2
    "bruh."; --3
    "are you serious right neow bro?"; --4
    "😱😱😱😱😱😭😭😭😭😔😠😠❤️❤️🔞👀😨😩⚪🥶🥶❔😎😋😉😘🤩😑🫥😪😝😮‍💨😮‍💨☹️😰😩😢🤯🤯🤯🤗"; --5

}

for Id,UserName in next, Whitelisted do
    if Id == userid then --Checks if their userid is whitelisted
        if UserName == plr.Name then --Checks if their name is also whitelisted aswell with their id (If so, it will do the magic and whitelist them to the script)
            
game:GetService("StarterGui"):SetCore("SendNotification", {
    Title = "Whitelisted!",
    Text = "Now the rest loads..",
    Duration = 5,
})

       	end
    else
        game.Players.LocalPlayer:Kick(Reasons[math.random(1, #Reasons)])
    end
end
